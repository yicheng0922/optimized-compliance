function min_overlap = SAT_first_check( shape1,shape2 )
% This function is written to test out the idea that the first half of the
% SAT function either returns a value that is larger than 0 (when two
% shapes are intersecting) or 0 (when two shape are separated) 



%   The function performs SAT test
%   For a shape that is a box, the normal of the two edges in different 
%   orientations will be used as test edges.
%   If the shape is a sector of a circle, the normal of two 
%   straight edges will be added.
%   After these axes have been added, the program will then add the 
%   the line connecting the centers if both of the shapes are fans, or 
%   the line connecting the center to the vertex of the box that is closest
%   to the center if only one of them is a fan.
%   please see extra_edge_fan_fan.png and extra_edge_fan_box.png for a
%   graphical explanation

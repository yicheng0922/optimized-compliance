function box_springs = generate_no_compression_spring_shapes( box_vertices_x, box_vertices_y , edge_spring_numbers, vertex_spring_numbers, spring_length)
%   This generates the shape information for the springs when there is no
%   compression.
%   
%   This function is supposed to generate the configurations 
%   that are not changing throughout the entire optimization process. 
%   The optimization program first create the springs given the 
%   polygon information and the spring length with this function.
%   Then in the constraint function, the compression on every spring will 
%   be pssed in and applied to the spring data. The modified data will be 
%   then used for SAT tests.
%
%   The function takes the following inputs:
%       box_vertices_x: A 1*4 array where every element is the x coordinate of
%                      a vertex from the box. The vertices should be in cw order
%       box_vertices_y: A 1*4 array where every element is the y coordinate of
%                      a vertex from the box. The vertices should be in cw order
%       edge_spring_numbers: A 1*4 array that holds how many springs should
%                           be on every edge
%       vertex_spring_numbers: A 1*4 array that holds how many springs
%                              should be on every vertex
%       spring_length: scalar representing the length of all springs
